VR Game Brainstorm Stuff

Environment: 
Dark forest
Low mist/fog on the floor
Mostly light from the sky
Some lights like fireflies

Movement:
Teleportation to different parts of the maps using trees as the teleport landing points
Movement on the ground (just regular stick movement or maybe using arms)

Gameplay:
Transformations
Limited time as a transformation
Different forms for different things
-One has ranged
-One is close combat
-One is movement
(I think, might flesh out more as I go)
Big map with enemies that start to attack from the outside
Kinda tower defense like, but with more movement and combat
